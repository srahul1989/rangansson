The Name
========
The inspiration for the name comes from Nordic patronymic naming traditions.
The Norse place a -sson (son of) or -dottir (daughter of) at the end of the
fathers name to create the last name. So if Odin had a son named Thor and a
daughter named Freya, they would be named Thor Odinsson and Freya Odindottir
respectively.

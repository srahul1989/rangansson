NOTES
=====

1. blue to red scale to represent relation names( blue - blood relation, red -
inlaws; cousing marrying would require a colour between red and blue)
2. date of birth and death displayed on the family tree
3. profile pages for each relation
4. no nationality (state, city of birth, etc). perhaps include this in profile
page
5. redraw tree based on who's viewing it
6. use levels. 0th level includes cousins, brothers/sisters. -Ith level
includes nieces/nephews, kids. +Ith has parents, uncles/aunts
7. default view has +II to -II (grandparents to grandkids)
8. have different tree viewing profiles - ancestry (to view upwards starting
from you), bloodline of a relative(to view kids/grandkids and so on of a
certain person)
9. different types of linking lines for married/divorced/etc
10. ON HANDLING SENSITIVE DATA
	10.1 only unlock after death of the person (or death of
	spouse/immediate family too)
	10.2 only visible to certain people/levels/of a certain age
	10.3 who adds the data, who verifies accuracy of subjective data?

11. report generation - printable, archivable, presentable
12. support for photos,facebook like tagging
13. based on (12) select photos only, say 1 or 2 per event or age bracket
of the person to prevent flooding (who decides which photos?)
14. scans of important documents for posterity and data accuracy
15. biological/adopted family trees, multiple trees for divorces/remarriages
16. divorces and remarriages would obviously only alter half the tree
17. A complete tree means sirnames/maiden names are unnecessary in most cases,
but not all.
